<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-contents-sign-up-for-a-weave-cloud-account">Sign up for a Weave Cloud account</h3>

Go to [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works/) and register for an account.
You'll use the Weave Cloud token later to send metrics to Cortex.


<h2 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-deploy-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-weave-net-and-then-deploy-a-sample-application-the-socks-shop-to-it">Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with Weave Net and then deploy a sample application (the socks shop) to it</h2>

If you have already done this as part of one of the other tutorials, you can skip this step.
Otherwise, click "Details" below to see the instructions.

<details>

**Note:** This example uses Digital Ocean, but you can just as easily create these two instances in AWS or whatever your favorite cloud provider is.

<h2 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-droplets-in-digital-ocean">Set Up Droplets in Digital Ocean</h2>

Sign up for [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) and create three Ubuntu instances, where you'll deploy a Kubernetes cluster, add a container network using Weave Net and finally deploy the Sock Shop onto the cluster and verify this deployment with the one you just did on your laptop in Weave Cloud.

**Note:** It is recommended that each host have at least 4 gigabytes of memory in order to run this demo smoothly.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-droplets-in-digital-ocean-create-two-ubuntu-instances">Create two Ubuntu Instances</h3>

Next you'll move over to Digital Ocean and create two Ubuntu droplets.
Both machines should run Ubuntu 16.04 with 4GB or more of RAM per machine.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-droplets-in-digital-ocean-adding-an-additional-instance-to-weave-cloud">Adding an Additional Instance to Weave Cloud</h3>

Before you start installing Kubernetes, create an additional instance in Weave Cloud. This extra instance assists you when you're deploying Kubernetes and will also allow you to see the Sock Shop as it spins up on Kubernetes.  

Select the 'Create New Instance' command located in the menu bar.


<h2 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster">Set up a Kubernetes Cluster</h2>

This is by far the simplest way in which to install Kubernetes.  In a few commands, you will have deployed a complete Kubernetes cluster with a resilient and secure container network onto the Cloud Provider of your choice.

The installation uses a tool called `kubeadm` which is part of Kubernetes 1.4.

This process works with local VMs, physical servers and/or cloud servers.
It is simple enough that you can easily integrate its use into your own automation (Terraform, Chef, Puppet, etc).

See the full [`kubeadm` reference](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm) for information on all `kubeadm` command-line flags and for advice on automating `kubeadm` itself.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-objectives">Objectives</h3>

* Install a secure Kubernetes cluster on your machines
* Install a pod network on the cluster so that application components (pods) can talk to each other
* Install a sample microservices application (a socks shop) on the cluster
* View the result in Weave Cloud as you go along

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-installing-kubelet-and-kubeadm-on-your-hosts">Installing kubelet and kubeadm on Your Hosts</h3>

You will install the following packages on all the machines:

* `docker`: the container runtime, which Kubernetes depends on. v1.11.2 is recommended, but v1.10.3 and v1.12.1 are known to work as well.
* `kubelet`: the most core component of Kubernetes.
  It runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.
* `kubectl`: the command to control the cluster once it's running.
  You will only need this on the master, but it can be useful to have on the other nodes as well.
* `kubeadm`: the command to bootstrap the cluster.

For each host:

* SSH into the machine and become `root` if you are not already (for example, run `sudo su -`):

~~~
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
cat <<EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
apt-get update
~~~

Install docker if you don't have it already. You can also use the [official Docker packages](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
~~~
apt-get install -y docker.io
apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni
~~~

**Note:** You may have to re-run `apt-get update` and then run `apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni` second time to ensure that the packages are properly downloaded.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-install-and-launch-weave-scope">Install and Launch Weave Scope</h3>

Install and launch the Weave Scope probes onto each of your Ubuntu instances:

~~~bash
sudo curl --silent --location https://git.io/scope --output /usr/local/bin/scope
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/scope
scope launch --service-token=<YOUR_WEAVE_CLOUD_SERVICE_TOKEN>
~~~

If you return to the Weave Cloud interface, you can click on the `Hosts` button and view your two Ubuntu hosts networked ready to go.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-initializing-the-master">Initializing the Master</h3>

The master is the machine where the "control plane" components run, including `etcd` (the cluster database) and the API server (which the `kubectl` CLI communicates with).

All of these components run in pods started by `kubelet`.

Right now you can't run `kubeadm init` twice without turning down the cluster in between, see [Tear Down](#tear-down).

To initialize the master, pick one of the machines you previously installed `kubelet` and `kubeadm` on, and run:

     # kubeadm init

**Note:** this will autodetect the network interface to advertise the master on as the interface with the default gateway.

If you want to use a different interface, specify `--api-advertise-addresses=<ip-address>` argument to `kubeadm init`.

Please refer to the [kubeadm reference doc](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm/) if you want to read more about the flags `kubeadm init` provides.

This command downloads and installs the cluster database and the "control plane" components.
This may take several minutes.

The output should look like:

~~~
<master/tokens> generated token: "f0c861.753c505740ecde4c"
<master/pki> created keys and certificates in "/etc/kubernetes/pki"
<util/kubeconfig> created "/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf"
<util/kubeconfig> created "/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf"
<master/apiclient> created API client configuration
<master/apiclient> created API client, waiting for the control plane to become ready
<master/apiclient> all control plane components are healthy after 61.346626 seconds
<master/apiclient> waiting for at least one node to register and become ready
<master/apiclient> first node is ready after 4.506807 seconds
<master/discovery> created essential addon: kube-discovery
<master/addons> created essential addon: kube-proxy
<master/addons> created essential addon: kube-dns

Kubernetes master initialised successfully!
You can connect any number of nodes by running:
    kubeadm join --token <token> <master-ip>
~~~

Make a record of the `kubeadm join` command that `kubeadm init` outputs.
You will need this in a moment.

The key included here is secret, keep it safe &mdash; anyone with this key can add authenticated nodes to your cluster.

The key is used for mutual authentication between the master and the joining nodes.

By default, your cluster will not schedule pods on the master for security reasons.
If you want to be able to schedule pods on the master, for example if you want a single-machine Kubernetes cluster for development, run:

~~~
    # kubectl taint nodes --all dedicated-
    node "test-01" tainted
    taint key="dedicated" and effect="" not found.
    taint key="dedicated" and effect="" not found.
~~~

This will remove the "dedicated" taint from any nodes that have it, including the master node, meaning that the scheduler will then be able to schedule pods everywhere.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-installing-weave-net">Installing Weave Net</h3>

You must install a pod network so that your pods can communicate with each other. This guide shows you how to install Weave Net.

**You must add Weave Net before deploying any applications to your cluster and before `kube-dns` starts up.**

Install [Weave Net](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-kube) by logging in to the master and running:

~~~
kubectl apply -f https://git.io/weave-kube
daemonset "weave-net" created
~~~

**Note:** Install **only one** pod network per cluster.

Once a pod network is installed, confirm that it is working by checking that the `kube-dns` pod is `Running` in the output of `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`.

And once the `kube-dns` pod is up and running, you can continue on to joining your nodes.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-joining-your-nodes">Joining Your Nodes</h3>

The nodes are where your workloads (containers and pods, etc) run.
If you want to add any new machines as nodes to your cluster, for each machine: SSH to that machine, become root (e.g. `sudo su -`) and run the command that was output by `kubeadm init`.
For example:

~~~
kubeadm join --token <token> <master-ip>
~~~

The output should look like:
~~~
<util/tokens> validating provided token
<node/discovery> created cluster info discovery client, requesting info from "http://X.X.X.X:9898/cluster-info/v1/?token-id=0f8588"
<node/discovery> cluster info object received, verifying signature using given token
<node/discovery> cluster info signature and contents are valid, will use API endpoints [https://X.X.X.X:443]
<node/csr> created API client to obtain unique certificate for this node, generating keys and certificate signing request
<node/csr> received signed certificate from the API server, generating kubelet configuration
<util/kubeconfig> created "/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf"
Node join complete:
* Certificate signing request sent to master and response
  received.
* Kubelet informed of new secure connection details.
~~~

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the master to see this machine join.

A few seconds later, you should notice that running `kubectl get nodes` on the master shows a cluster with as many machines as you created.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-optional-control-your-cluster-from-machines-other-than-the-master">(Optional) Control Your Cluster From Machines Other Than The Master</h3>

In order to get kubectl on (for example) your laptop to talk to your cluster, you need to copy the `kubeconfig` file from your master to your laptop like this:

~~~
scp root@<master ip>:/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf .
kubectl --kubeconfig ./admin.conf get nodes
~~~

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-installing-the-sock-shop-onto-kubernetes">Installing the Sock Shop onto Kubernetes</h3>

As an example, install a sample microservices application, a socks shop, to put your cluster through its paces.
To learn more about the sample microservices app, see the [microservices-demo README](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo).

~~~
kubectl create namespace sock-shop
kubectl apply -n sock-shop -f "https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/complete-demo.yaml?raw=true"
~~~

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-viewing-the-sock-shop-in-your-browser">Viewing the Sock Shop in Your Browser</h3>

You can then find the port that the [NodePort feature of services](/docs/user-guide/services/) allocated for the front-end service by running:

~~~
kubectl describe svc front-end -n sock-shop
Name:                   front-end
Namespace:              sock-shop
Labels:                 name=front-end
Selector:               name=front-end
Type:                   NodePort
IP:                     100.66.88.176
Port:                   <unset> 80/TCP
NodePort:               <unset> 31869/TCP
Endpoints:              <none>
Session Affinity:       None
~~~

It takes several minutes to download and start all of the containers, watch the output of `kubectl get pods -n sock-shop` to see when they're all up and running.

Or you can view the containers appearing on the screen as they get created in Weave Cloud.

Then go to the IP address of your cluster's master node in your browser, and specify the given port.
So for example, `http://<master_ip>:<port>`.

In the example above, this was `31869`, but it is a different port for you.

If there is a firewall, make sure it exposes this port to the internet before you try to access it.

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-viewing-the-result-in-weave-cloud">Viewing the Result in Weave Cloud</h3>

You can also view the result in Weave Cloud and also watch all of the pods as they join the cluster.

[weave cloud screenshot]


<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-run-the-load-test-on-the-cluster">Run the Load Test on the Cluster</h3>

After the Sock Shop has completely deployed onto the cluster, run the same load test as you did on your laptop and then view the results in Weave Cloud.

~~~
docker run -ti --rm --name=LOAD_TEST  weaveworksdemos/load-test -h edge-router -r 100 -c 2 <host-ip:[port number]>
~~~

Where,

* `<host-ip:[port number]>` is the IP of the master and the port number you see when you run `kubectl describe svc front-end -n sock-shop`


</details>

```
XXX: instructions need to _not_ apply network policy yet.
```


<h2 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-monitor-the-network-with-weave-cortex-part-of-weave-cloud">Monitor the network with Weave Cortex, part of Weave Cloud</h2>

Cortex is a hosted, scalable Prometheus Monitoring system built-in to Weave Cloud.
Weave Net supports Prometheus monitoring.

Here we'll use Cortex and Net together to monitor the health of the Weave Network.
As examples, we'll be able to see:

* how many IP addresses are allocated to containers as a percentage of available IP addresses on the Weave Network
* how many connections get made in total between all components as we apply a load test (so we can calculate the impact of a microservices architecture on the network)
* how many connections get blocked when we apply some network policy
* (TODO - maybe later) how many connection issues occur when a partial network partition between nodes in the cluster is experienced (and how Weave Net carries on working)

<h3 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-monitor-the-network-with-weave-cortex-part-of-weave-cloud-deploy-socks-shop">Deploy socks shop</h3>

On the master:

```
# kubectl create namespace sock-shop
# git clone https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo
# kubectl apply -n sock-shop -f microservices-demo/manifests
```

It takes several minutes to download and start all the containers, watch the output of `kubectl get pods -n sock-shop` to see when they're all up and running.


<h2 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-secure-the-application-by-applying-network-policy-which-gets-enforced-by-weave-net">Secure the application by applying Network Policy, which gets enforced by Weave Net</h2>

Now we'll use Kubernetes policy to secure the application.

Let's start by finding out that the application is not yet secured.
Supposed that a hacker is able to infiltrate ...

Before - container A can talk to container B.
Don't want it to be able to â€“ apply policy.
Oh look, now it can't (all through Scope).


<h2 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-tear-down">Tear Down</h2>

<details>

Unless you are continuing onto another guide, or going to use the cluster for your own app, you may want to tear down the Sock Shop and also the Kubernetes cluster you created.

If you made a mistep during the install instructions, it is recommended that you delete the entire cluster and begin again.

* To uninstall the socks shop, run `kubectl delete namespace sock-shop` on the master.

* To uninstall Kubernetes on the machines, simply delete the machines you created for this tutorial, or run the script below and then start over or uninstall the packages.

To reset local state run the following script:

~~~
systemctl stop kubelet;
docker rm -f -v $(docker ps -q);
find /var/lib/kubelet | xargs -n 1 findmnt -n -t tmpfs -o TARGET -T | uniq | xargs -r umount -v;
rm -r -f /etc/kubernetes /var/lib/kubelet /var/lib/etcd;
~~~

<h2 id="secure-container-firewalls-network-monitoring-recreating-the-cluster-starting-over">Recreating the Cluster: Starting Over</h2>

If you wish to start over, run `systemctl start kubelet` followed by `kubeadm init` on the master and `kubeadm join` on any of the nodes.
