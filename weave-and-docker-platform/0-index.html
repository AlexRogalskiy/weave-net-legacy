This three part tutorial is an introduction to using Weave with the Docker platform. 
  
As there are several complex concepts in such integration, we chose to break it up into small distinct chapters, so a beginner can do it step by
step. In this guide we utilise all 3 great components of the Docker platform (Machine, Swarm &amp; Compose). If you follow
through with all 4 sections, you should understand the requirements of setting up a scalable cluster of Docker hosts
with Weave tools and also to deploy your application to it with ease. 


*Part 1: Setting up Weave and Docker
*Part 2: Using Weave with Docker Machine and Swarm
*Part 3: Creating and Scaling a Multi-host Docker deployment with Swarm and Compose using Weave
