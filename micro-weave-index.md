Weave provides a software network optimized for visualizing and communicating with apps distributed among Docker containers. Using tools and protocols that are familiar to you, Weave's network provides a way for you to communicate between containerized apps distributed across multiple networks or hosts more quickly and efficiently.
 
The following guides demonstrate how Weave works with containerized microservices: 

* [Service Discovery and Load Balancing with Weave on Amazon ECS](/guides/service-discovery-with-weave-aws-ecs.html)
* [Using Nginx as a reverse proxy/load balancer with Weave and Docker on Amazon Web Services](/guides/weave-docker-aws-nginx-ubuntu-simple.html)
* [Deploying a containerized app with Weave on AWS using Ansible](/guides/weave-ansible-docker-haproxy-aws.html)
